# Combining straight-line and map-based distances to investigate the connection between proximity to healthy foods and disease

This repository contains R code and simulation data to reproduce results from the manuscript by Lotspeich, Mullan, D'Agostino McGowan, and Hepler (2023+). 

These simulations rely on the `possum` package, which implements the multiple imputation approach for covariate measurement error in Poisson regression from the paper. The package can be found in its own repo [here](https://github.com/sarahlotspeich/possum) and installed in `R` as follows:

``` r
# Run once
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sarahlotspeich/possum", ref = "main")
```

## Primary Data Source (Analysis)

**1.  Merged Food Access Measures and Disease Prevalence** created using the **Healthy Food Store Locations**, **Disease Prevalence by Neighborhood (Census Tract)**, and **Neighborhood (Census Tract) Population Centers**. 

  - [Script (Calculate Proximity)](piedmont-triad-data/raw_proximity_healthy_foods.R)
  - *Note:* A small number of census tract population centers could not be geocoded based on the original address. They were manually reviewed and assigned the nearest address that *would* geocode, and then their proximity to healthy foods was recalculated. See the [raw data](piedmont-triad-data/raw_proximity_healthy_foods.csv) and [Script](piedmont-triad-data/review_proximity_healthy_foods.R) for more details.
